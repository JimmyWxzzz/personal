This is a simple TCP Server/Client project where the client send messages to the server and the server echos back to the current client

To Setup the server/client:

1. Redirect to the current directory

2. gcc server_echo.c -o server

3. gcc client_echo.c -o client

4. ./server

5. ./client (use -i for diffrent ip or -p for different port)
